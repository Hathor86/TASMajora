Rupees:

To buy:
Tingle maps (45 rupees) and red potion (30 rupees)

I have now 50 rupees. I can collect without losing time
* 50 rupees from Deku Game
* 70 rupees where DampÃ© stands (50 in the pot and 20 shure from the Wallmaster)
* 20 rupees under the graveyard (on the way to the first Iron Knuckle who gives a H.P.)
* 40 rupees bottle dupe

Against a cost of little time spent (that's what I try to measure), I can collect:
* those 60 rupees (or 40 or 20)
* there are 6 green rupees surrounding the red one under the graveyard
* 100 rupees when beating dodongo's to get the H.P (or 50 if I collect only one rupee)
* 200 rupees bottle dupe

=> Collect 50 from dodongo
